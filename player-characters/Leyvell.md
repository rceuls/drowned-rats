When you get asked to **roll a save**, roll a D20 and add the relevant modifier. If you the total is **greater than 15** you succeed. You may also be asked to roll versus the defense of an opponent (for example, DEX vs WIS for stealth). In that case you need to beat the defense of the opponent. You might get advantage or disadvantage in which case you roll 2d20. In case of advantage you pick the dice; in case of disadvantage the GM does.
